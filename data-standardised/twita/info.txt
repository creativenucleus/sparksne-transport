* Car park data for three car parks

Data is updated every minute; therefore for storage reasons we do not keep it that long.  I have given you April 2013. All other data sets include this time period.... (as an aside, we currently do not have the data on the metrocentre car parks but will do in the future, all the other data has links to the metrocentre so given this is an exploration for us re what's possible - people could conceivably pretend the car park data is actually for metrocentre car parks for illustrative purposes of matching various datasets together etc)



* SCOOT data for two links at the Metrocentre.  It should be noted that link speed defaults to 80kph when there is no flow as this is the permitted speed for the road.



* Air quality data for two sites.  This starts around April/May last year.



* Travel times and incidents for the A1 refer to the stretches of road as per table below.

* All
 
All data sets apart from Car Parks and Air quality cover the period 1 Jan 2012 - 30 April 2013.  Where a data set exceeds 60k or so records, data is automatically added to sheet 2 (and if needed sheet 3) in the file.
