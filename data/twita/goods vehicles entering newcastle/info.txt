Goods vehicle data analysis entering Newcastle - the “all goods vehicles” tab shows data that has been re-based to 2011 and the figures extrapolated forward to 2020. For the period up to 2013, they show an approximate 7% reduction in vehicle numbers and a 17,000 vehicle km per month reduction in distance travelled. The other tabs on the spreadsheet show the breakdown between heavy goods and light goods vehicles, with the former showing an even greater reduction.
